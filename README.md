### **INSTALLING THE LATEST VERSION**

To access the latest version of LOOM, you will have to have a python interpreter installed on your computer. It can be installed from the official python website: https://www.python.org/

**NOTICE:** LOOM is only available for Windows OS, therefore, the steps described here will only be functional if performed inside the Windows Operation System.

Having a python interpreter installed, open the command prompt, select the folder of your choice to install LOOM, and type:

```
git clone https://github.com/Idoraconk/LOOM.git
```

Once downloaded, access the path to the LOOM folder via cmd in the directory where the folder was installed and type:

```
python release.py
```

The file ''release.py'' will install the latest version of LOOM. After that, go to the repository of the latest version and follow the setup steps.
